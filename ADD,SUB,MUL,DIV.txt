7. WAP to create a simple calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using
switch case (Menu driven programming). If user enters operator as choice as follows
a) + for Addition
b) – for Subtraction
c) * for Multiplication
d) / for Division
If user enters wrong choice appropriate message should be displayed
.


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    int ch;
    
    printf("\n Enter Choice '1' for ADDITION  '2' for SUBSTRACTION '3' for MULTIPLICATION AND '4' for DIVISION");
    
    printf("\nEnter the choice:");
    scanf("%d",&ch);
    
    switch(ch)
    { 
    case 1 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Addition of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Addition is %d",a+b);
    
    break;
    }
       
    case 2 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Subtraction of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Subtracion is %d",a-b);
    
    break;
    }
    
    case 3 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Multiplication of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Subtracion is %d",a*b);
    
    break;
    
    case 4 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Division of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Subtracion is %d",a/b);
    
    break;
    }
    }
    
    
     default:
     printf("\n The wrong choice");
     break;
    } 
    return 0;
