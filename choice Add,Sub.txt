2. WAP using switch case for arithmetic operation on two numbers, if user enters an operator as
choice, the appropriate operation should perform.
If user enters wrong choice appropriate message should get displayed.
i.e. + is for addition
     - is for subtraction
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    int ch;
    
    printf("\n Enter Choice '1' for ADDITION OR '2' for SUBSTRACTION");
    
    printf("\nEnter the choice:");
    scanf("%d",&ch);
    
    switch(ch)
    { 
    case 1 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Addition of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Addition is %d",a+b);
    
    break;
    }
       
    case 2 :
    {
    printf("\nEnter the Subtraction of a and b is");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
        
    printf("\nThe Subtracion is %d",a-b);
    
    break;
    }
    
    
     default:
     printf("\n The wrong choice");
     break;
    } 
    return 0;
}


/*0/p--
1)Enter Choice '1' for ADDITION OR '2' for SUBSTRACTION
Enter the choice:1

Enter the Addition of a and b is 2 6
2 6

The Addition is 8

2)Enter Choice '1' for ADDITION OR '2' for SUBSTRACTION
Enter the choice:2

Enter the Subtraction of a and b is 8 4
8 4

The Subtracion is 4
